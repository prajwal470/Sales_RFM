# Introduction
In a world where businesses are growing tremendously, and cater to a large number of customers
on a regular basis. It becomes very essential for businesses to categorize their customers.
Customer segmentation is an effective tool for businesses to closely align their strategy and
tactics with, and better target, their customers. Every customer is different and every customer
journey is different so a single approach often isnâ€™t going to work for all. This is where customer
segmentation becomes a valuable process.
Problem Description
To bulid RFM Value and categorize the customers for given Data set
This project has been completed in 5 steps :-
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Transformation
4. Clustering and segmentation
5. Data visulization
# 1) data Cleaning 
    * the data set was clean we given
# 2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     *156 is the Highest Ordes from a single person
     * 34847 is the highest revenue from a single person
     * Thursday and Sunday are the Highest in revenue and Order place
     * most Shopping happens at month End

# 3) Data Transformation
    * In this section, a Recency, Frequency and Monetary analysis Model was developed for each
    customerID
# 4) Clustering and 5) segmentation
    * In this section, the optimum number of clusters were chosen via elbow method It was found that
      4 clusters would be the most optimum.
    * A KMeans model with 4 clusters was developed.
    * Each customer ID was clustered into one of the 4 clusters. and named based on their Score
      Champions , Loyal , Potential , Requires Attention.
# 6) Data Data visulization
      * Ploted some pie chart and barchart for further analysis
      * On the basis of this analysis, the business can offer attractive deals to its Potential and low value customers and they can also treat their high value
         customers with special business offers such as loyalty points.
